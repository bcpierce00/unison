.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Unison
is a file-synchronization tool for POSIX-compliant systems (e.g. *BSD and
GNU/Linux, macOS) and Windows. It allows two replicas of a collection of files
and directories to be stored on different hosts (or different disks on the same
host), modified separately, and then brought up to date by propagating the
changes in each replica to the other.
.Pp
Unison has been in use for over 20 years and many people use it to synchronize
data they care about.
.Pp
Unison shares a number of features with other tools. Some of the distinguishing
features are:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Unlike simple mirroring or backup utilities, Unison can deal with updates to
both replicas of a distributed directory structure.
.It
Unison works across platforms, allowing you to synchronize a Windows laptop
with a Unix server, for example.
.It
Unlike most distributed filesystems, Unison is a user-level program that simply
uses normal systems calls: there is no need to modify the kernel, to have
superuser privileges on either host, or to have a FUSE implementation.
.It
Unison works between any pair of machines connected to the internet, typically
communicating over
.Xr ssh 1 ,
but also directly over TCP. It is careful with network bandwidth, and runs well
over slow links. Transfers of small updates to large files are optimized using
a compression protocol similar to
.Xr rsync 1 .
.It
Unison is resilient to failure. It is careful to leave the replicas and its own
private structures in a sensible state at all times, even in case of abnormal
termination or communication failures.
.El
.Sh OPTION SUMMARY
@OPTIONS_SHORT@
.Sh OPTIONS
Most of the options can be given as command line arguments or in a profile. On
command line, but not in a profile, the options are specified with a leading
dash. Like this:
.Fl option .
@OPTIONS_FULL@
.Sh ROOTS
A replica’s root tells Unison where to find a set of files to be synchronized,
either on the local machine or on
a remote host. For example,
.Pp
.Dl relative/path/of/root
.Pp
specifies a local root relative to the directory where Unison is started, while
.Pp
.Dl /absolute/path/of/root
.Pp
specifies a root relative to the top of the local filesystem, independent of
where Unison is running. Remote roots can begin with
.Sy ssh://
to indicate that the remote server should be started with
.Xr ssh 1 :
.Pp
.Dl ssh://remotehost//absolute/path/of/root
.Dl ssh://user@remotehost/relative/path/of/root
.Pp
If the remote server is already running (in the socket mode), then the syntax
.Pp
.Dl socket://remotehost:portnum//absolute/path/of/root
.Dl socket://remotehost:portnum/relative/path/of/root
.Dl socket://[IPv6literal]:portnum/path
.Pp
is used to specify the hostname and the port that the client Unison should use
to contact it. Syntax
.Pp
.Dl socket://{path/of/socket}//absolute/path/of/root
.Dl socket://{path/of/socket}/relative/path/of/root
.Pp
is used to specify the Unix domain socket the client Unison should use to
contact the server.
.Pp
The syntax for roots is based on that of URIs (described in RFC 2396). The full
grammar is:
.Bd -literal
  replica ::= [protocol:]//[user@][host][:port][/path]
           |  path

  protocol ::= file
            |  socket
            |  ssh

  user ::= [-_a-zA-Z0-9]+

  host ::= [-_a-zA-Z0-9.]+
        |  \e[ [a-f0-9:.]+ zone? \e]     IPv6 literals (no future format).
        |  { [^}]+ }                   For Unix domain sockets only.

  zone ::= %[-_a-zA-Z0-9~%.]+

  port ::= [0-9]+

.Ed
When path is given without any protocol prefix, the protocol is assumed to be
.Sy file: .
Under Windows, it is possible to synchronize with a remote directory using the
.Sy file:
protocol over the Windows Network Neighborhood. For example,
.Pp
.Dl unison foo //host/drive/bar
.Pp
synchronizes the local directory
.Pa foo
with the directory
.Pa drive:\ebar
on the machine
.Sy host ,
provided that host is accessible via Network Neighborhood. When the
.Sy file:
protocol is used in this way, there is no need for a Unison server to be
running on the remote host. However, running Unison this way is only a good
idea if the remote host is reached by a very fast network connection, since the
full contents of every file in the remote replica will have to be transferred
to the local machine to detect updates.
.Sh PATHS
A path refers to a point within a set of files being synchronized; it is
specified relative to the root of the replica. Formally, a path is just a
sequence of names, separated by /. Note that the path separator character is
always a forward slash, no matter what operating system Unison is running on.
The empty path (i.e., the empty sequence of names) denotes the whole replica.
.Sh PATH SPECIFICATION
Several Unison preferences (e.g.,
.Sy ignore/ignorenot , follow , sortfirst/sortlast , backup , merge ,
etc.) specify individual paths or sets of paths. These preferences share a
common syntax based on regular expressions. Each preference is associated with
a list of path patterns; the paths specified are those that match any one of
the path pattern.
.Pp
Each pattern can have one of three forms. The most general form is a Posix
extended regular expression introduced by the keyword
.Sy Regex .
(The collating sequences and character classes of full Posix regexps are not
currently supported.)
.Pp
.Dl Cm Regex Ar regexp
.Pp
For convenience, three other styles of pattern are also recognized:
.Pp
.Dl Cm Name Ar name
.Pp
matches any path in which the last component matches
.Ar name ,
.Pp
.Dl Cm Path Ar path
.Pp
matches exactly the path
.Ar path ,
and
.Pp
.Dl Cm BelowPath Ar path
.Pp
matches the path
.Ar path
and any path below. The
.Ar name
and
.Ar path
arguments of the latter forms of patterns are
.Em not
regular expressions. Instead, standard
.Dq globbing
conventions can be used in
.Ar name
and
.Ar path :
.Bl -dash
.It
a
.Sy "*"
matches any sequence of characters not including / (and not beginning with .,
when used at the beginning of a
.Ar name )
.It
a
.Sy \&?
matches any single character except / (and leading .)
.It
.Sy [xyz]
matches any character from the set {x, y, z}
.It
.Sy {a,bb,ccc}
matches any one of a, bb, or ccc. (Be careful not to put extra spaces after the
commas: these will be interpreted literally as part of the strings to be
matched!)
.El
.Pp
The path separator in path patterns is always the forward-slash character
.Dq /
— even when the client or server is running under Windows, where the normal
separator character is a backslash. This makes it possible to use the same set
of path patterns for both Unix and Windows file systems.
.Pp
A path specification may be followed by the separator
.Dq " -> "
itself followed by a string which will be associated to the matching paths:
.Pp
.Dl Cm Path Ar path No -> Ar "associated string"
.Pp
Not all pathspec preferences use these associated strings but all pathspec
preferences are parsed identically and the strings may be ignored. Only the
last match of the separator string on the line is used as a delimiter. Thus to
allow a path specification to contain the separator string, append an
associated string to it, even if it is not used. The associated string cannot
contain the separator string.
.Sh PROFILES
A profile is a text file that specifies permanent settings for roots, paths,
ignore patterns, and other preferences, so that they do not need to be typed at
the command line every time Unison is run. Profiles should reside in the
.Pa .unison
directory on the client machine. If Unison is started with just one argument
.Ar name
on the
command line, it looks for a profile called
.Em name Ns Sy .prf
in the
.Pa .unison
directory. If it is started with no arguments, it scans the
.Pa .unison
directory for files whose names end in
.Sy .prf
and offers a menu (when using the graphical user interface; for the text
interface, you have to use the
.Fl i
option). If a file named
.Pa default.prf
is found, its settings will be used as the default preferences.
.Pp
To set the value of a preference
.Sy p
permanently, add to the appropriate profile a line of the form
.Pp
.Dl p = true
.Pp
for a boolean flag or
.Pp
.Dl p = <value>
.Pp
for a preference of any other type.
Whitespaces around
.Sy p
and the value are ignored. A profile may also include blank lines and lines
beginning with #; both are ignored.
.Pp
When Unison starts, it first reads the profile and then the command line, so
command-line options will override settings from the profile.
.Sh TERMINATION
When not synchronizing continuously, the text interface terminates when
synchronization is finished normally or due to a fatal error occurring.
.Pp
In the text interface, to interrupt synchronization before it is finished,
press
.Sy Ctrl-C
(or send signal
.Sy SIGINT
or
.Sy SIGTERM ) .
This will interrupt update propagation as quickly as possible but still
complete proper cleanup. If the process does not stop even after pressing
.Sy Ctrl-C
then keep doing it repeatedly. This will bypass cleanup procedures and
terminates the process forcibly (similar to
.Sy SIGKILL ) .
Doing so may leave the archives or replicas in an inconsistent state or locked.
.Pp
When synchronizing continuously (time interval repeat or with filesystem
monitoring), interrupting with
.Sy Ctrl-C
or with signal
.Sy SIGINT
or
.Sy SIGTERM
works the same way as described above and will additionally stop the continuous
process. To stop only the continuous process and let the last synchronization
complete normally, send signal
.Sy SIGUSR2
instead.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag
.It Ev UNISON
Unison stores a variety of information in a private directory on each host. If
the environment variable
.Sy UNISON
is defined, then its value will be used as the path for this directory. This
can be just a name, or a path. If
.Sy UNISON
is not defined, then the directory depends on which operating system you are
using. In Unix, the default is to use
.Pa $HOME/.unison .
In Windows, if the environment variable
.Sy USERPROFILE
is defined, then the directory will be
.Pa $USERPROFILE\e.unison ;
otherwise, it will be
.Pa c:\e.unison .
On macOS,
.Pa $HOME/.unison
will be used if it is present, but
.Pa "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Unison"
will be created and used by default.
.It Ev UNISONLOCALHOSTNAME
The function that finds the canonical hostname of the local host (which is
used, for example, in calculating the name of the archive file used to remember
which files have been synchronized) normally uses the
.Sy gethostname
operating system call. However, if the environment variable
.Sy UNISONLOCALHOSTNAME
is set, its value will be used instead. This makes it easier to use Unison in
situations where a machine’s name changes frequently (e.g., because it is a
laptop and gets moved around a lot).
.It Ev UNISONBACKUPDIR
When backups are stored centrally, the directory used to hold them is
controlled by the preference
.Sy backupdir
and the environment variable
.Sy UNISONBACKUPDIR .
If both are specified then the environment variable overrides the preference.
If neither of these are set, then the directory
.Pa $UNISON/backup
is used (see environment variable
.Sy UNISON
above).
.It Ev PAGER
Used by the text interface as the pager when displaying the differences between
changed files.
.It Ev NO_COLOR
If the environment variable
.Sy NO_COLOR
is set then Unison's text interface will not produce any color output by
default. The
.Sy color
preference overrides this environment variable.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -compact
.It Pa ~/.unison
Unison stores a variety of information in a private directory on each host.
This is the default path of this private directory. This path may be changed by
the
.Sy UNISON
environment variable.
.Pp
.It Pa ~/.unison/*.prf
Profile files. Each profile is stored in a file named
.Em profilename Ns Sy .prf .
.Pp
.It Pa ~/.unison/ar*
.It Pa ~/.unison/tm*
.It Pa ~/.unison/sc*
Main and temporary archive files. These files may be deleted if you know what
you are doing. Deleting an archive file is equivalent to using the
.Fl ignorearchives
option.
.Pp
.It Pa ~/.unison/fp*
Fingerprint cache files. These files may be safely deleted. Keep in mind that
deleting a fingerprint cache file means that any unsynchronized changes must be
scanned again. Depending on your replicas, this may mean scanning gigabytes of
file contents.
.Pp
.It Pa ~/.unison/lk*
Lock files indicating a running Unison process. These files may be deleted if
you are careful and know that there is no Unison process currently running.
Deleting a lock file is equivalent to using the
.Fl ignorelocks
option.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bl -tag -width ""
.It Sy Synchronize two local directories
.Pp
.Dl unison path/to/dir1 /dir2
.Pp
This command synchronizes two local directories using the default options.
Default options are defined by Unison and can be overridden by user in a
profile called
.Dq default ,
which is by default stored in file
.Pa ~/.unison/default.prf
.It Sy Synchronize a local and a remote directory
.Pp
.Dl unison local/dir ssh://user@host//absolute/path
.Pp
This command synchronizes a local directory (here specified by a relative path)
and a remote directory (here specified by an absolute path) using
.Xr ssh 1
and the default options (see example above).
.It Sy Synchronize with all options specified in a profile
.Pp
.Dl unison profilename
.Pp
This command reads all the options from the profile named
.Dq profilename
and synchronizes according to those options.
.It Sy Synchronize with options specified in a profile and roots on command line
.Pp
.Dl unison profilename /path/to/dir ssh://host/path/on/server
.Pp
This command reads all options from the profile named
.Dq profilename
with only the roots specified on the command line. Roots must not be specified
in the profile as the roots from command line will not override roots in the
profile, rather append to the list of roots.
.It Sy Synchronize automatically
.Pp
.Dl unison -batch /path/to/dir ssh://host/path/on/server
.Pp
This command synchronizes all non-conflicting changes automatically, once.
.It Sy Synchronize continuously
.Pp
.Dl unison -repeat watch /path/to/dir ssh://host/path/on/server
.Pp
This command first fully synchronizes the roots and then remains dormant,
waiting for any file changes within either root and then automatically
synchronizes these changes. This also works in a profile
.No ( Ns Sy "repeat = watch" ) .
If the filesystem monitoring helper program is not available or not desired for
other reasons, it is possible to make Unison synchronize repeatedly with a
defined time interval:
.Pp
.Dl unison -repeat 60 /path/to/dir ssh://host/path/on/server
.Pp
This command synchronizes every 60 seconds. Using
.Fl repeat
implies
.Fl batch .
.Pp
Currently, continuous synchronization is not possible when using the GUI.
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
When running in the textual mode, Unison returns an exit status, which
describes whether, and at which level, the synchronization was successful. The
exit status could be useful when Unison is invoked from a script. Currently,
there are four possible values for the exit status:
.Bl -tag -width 1m
.It 0
successful synchronization; everything is up-to-date now.
.It 1
some files were skipped, but all file transfers were successful.
.It 2
non-fatal failures occurred during file transfer.
.It 3
a fatal error occurred, or the execution was interrupted.
.El
.Pp
The graphical interface does not return any useful information through the exit
status.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
If you are using Unison versions \*(>= 2.52 on all machines, you do not have to
do anything extra for compatibility.
.Pp
Historically (versions \*(Lt 2.52), Unison versions had to be matched
relatively exactly for them to work together. Additionally, the version of
compiler used to build Unison also had significant relevance for compatibility.
.Pp
As of version 2.52, Unison has a degree of backward and forward compatibility.
This means three things. First, it is possible for local and remote machines to
run a different version of Unison. Second, it is possible for local and remote
machines to run a version (same or different) of Unison built with a different
version of compiler. Lastly, it is possible to upgrade Unison on the local
machine and keep the existing archive.
.Pp
For more information on co-existence of versions \*(Lt 2.52 and \*(>= 2.52, see
.Lk https://github.com/bcpierce00/unison/wiki/2.52-Migration-Guide
.Sh SEE ALSO
There is a full user manual (pdf, html and txt) included with Unison and
available online. Depending on your operating system, this manual may have been
installed at
.Pa /usr/share/doc/unison/
or a similar location. The manual can also be read in the GUI (look in the Help
menu) or on the command line by
.Sy unison -doc all
(you probably want to pipe the output to a pager).
