# Installing Unison

## Pre-built binaries

The easiest and quickest way is to install pre-built binaries available at many
package repositories. The caveat: some repositories are slow to update and
often include a very old version of Unison.

Alternatively, some pre-built binaries are made available at
https://github.com/bcpierce00/unison/releases for macOS, Linux and Windows.
No specific installation is needed, just unpack the files at a location of your
choosing.


## Building from source

### Package repositories

Many package repositories, including source-based repositories like `pkgsrc`,
make it easy to build from source by handling all the dependencies for you.
Please refer to instructions provided by the repository.


### Unix-like OS (GNU/Linux, BSDs, macOS, illumos-based OS, Solaris) and Cygwin

#### Build prerequisites

- A recent version of OCaml compiler (version 4.08 at minimum) together with a
  C99 compiler (such as gcc, clang) -- see https://ocaml.org/
- GNU make
- Basic POSIX tools: sh, sed (optional, for manuals)

##### Optional, for the GUI only

- lablgtk3 and its prerequisites (ocamlfind, GTK 3 and its dependencies)

##### Optional, for building the user manual

- LaTeX
- pdf2ps (optional, for PS output; included with Ghostscript, for example)
- HEVEA (https://hevea.inria.fr/) (optional, for HTML and text formats)
- Lynx (optional, for text format)
- (for developers only) HEVEA and Lynx are required to re-build the manual
  included in the Unison binary

#### Building

Building from source is as simple as executing:
```
make
```

Use `gmake` in environments where GNU make is not the default. If you are
using OPAM then `opam exec -- make` may work for you, as opam needs to set up
a specific environment.

Presence of lablgtk3 is detected automatically to build the GUI. If you want
to build only the GUI, type `make gui`. You can type `make tui` if you have
lablgtk3 installed but don't want the GUI built. Type `make fsmonitor` to build
only the filesystem monitor.

There is currently no installation provided by the makefile. You can just copy
the built binaries to where you need them. The following files are produced:
```
src/unison              (the main executable for TUI/CLI)
src/unison-gui          (the main executable for GUI)
src/unison-fsmonitor    (optional, on some build platforms)
src/fsmonitor.py        (optional, if unison-fsmonitor is not built)
man/unison.1            (optional, manual page)
doc/unison-manual.*     (optional, user manual in different formats)
```

#### Building all from scratch

It is very easy to build both the OCaml compiler and Unison from source without
using a package repository. Building OCaml has very few prerequisites. If your
system has a supported C compiler installed then the following may work out of
the box:

```
# Build OCaml compiler
## In a dir with extracted OCaml source
./configure
make
make install    # you may need elevated privileges

# Build unison
## In a dir with extracted Unison source
make
```

Building the GTK GUI this way is difficult as both GTK 3 and lablgtk3 must be
built and installed.

### Cross-compiling for a different target architecture or OS

To cross-compile for a different target, you need to have a cross-compilation
toolchain including both a cross-compiling C compiler and a cross-compiling
OCaml compiler. When you have cross-compilation toolchain in place, building
Unison from source works according to instructions above. You just have to add
an `TOOL_PREFIX` argument to `make` to indicate which toolchain to use (also
ensure the tools are in PATH).

For example, to build a native Windows 64-bit executable using the MinGW
cross-compilation toolchain:
```
make TOOL_PREFIX=x86_64-w64-mingw32-
```

Building the manual page and documentation does not work when cross-compiling.
To build the documentation, first build Unison without cross-compilation.


### macOS

#### Build prerequisites

- Xcode Command Line Tools (optional, for the native GUI)

#### Building

The Unix instructions above will build the text user interface, the GTK GUI
and, if you're building on macOS, also the macOS native GUI.

To build only the macOS native GUI, execute:
```
make macui
```

The built application will be located at `src/uimac/build/Default/Unison.app`.


### Windows

Building on Windows is currently somewhat complicated. All methods require
Cygwin as a POSIX-like layer for Windows. Cygwin is required for the build
process only; the build can produce fully native Windows binaries that don't
require Cygwin to run. To build Unison for usage within Cygwin environment,
follow build instructions for Unix-like OS above.

Builds are possible with MS Visual C++ (MSVC) (currently untested and likely
not working) and MinGW-w64 (currently the best option) compilers.

The build system automatically detects if the build is of MSVC, MinGW or Cygwin
GNU C (not native Windows) type based on the first OCaml compiler (ocamlc and
ocamlopt) found on PATH. Thus, if you have multiple compilers, you can easily
select between these methods by adjusting the PATH accordingly when running
`make`.

#### MinGW

Building with MinGW, you still need a Cygwin installation as the build
environment. It is not required to run the produced executables. You need to
have the following prerequisites:

- MinGW gcc and MinGW binutils (Cygwin package example mingw64-x86_64-gcc-core)
- A recent version of OCaml compiler (version 4.08 at minimum) which itself is
  built with MinGW gcc (it is possible to find pre-compiled binaries); do not
  use the Cygwin OCaml package as that is not compiled with MinGW
- GNU make
- A POSIX shell (available in Cygwin by default)

To build, change to directory where Unison source code is and execute:
```
make
```

If all goes well, the following files will be produced:
```
src/unison.exe              (the main executable for TUI/CLI)
src/unison-gui.exe          (the main executable for GUI, optional, see below)
src/unison-fsmonitor.exe    (filesystem monitor, optional)
```

You can check which DLLs are needed by the built binary by executing
`cygcheck src/unison.exe` or `ldd src/unison.exe`.

For building the GUI (optional), you also need the following:

- MinGW GTK 3 and its dependencies (Cygwin package example mingw64-x86_64-gtk3)
- Some MinGW GTK icon theme (optional, but recommended; Cygwin package example
  mingw64-x86_64-adwaita-icon-theme)
- lablgtk3 and its prerequisites (ocamlfind, dune build system)

Building lablgtk3 from source is complicated. It is recommended to use OPAM for
that (Cygwin package name opam). Make sure that OPAM uses the MinGW version of
gcc and binutils.

#### MSVC

Building with MSVC is in principle similar to building with MinGW, except that
the C compiler is now MSVC and the OCaml compiler must itself be built with
MSVC (it is possible to find pre-compiler binaries). Environment for MSVC must
be set up properly so that it can be used from Cygwin environment.


### Build options

There are some additional options that control the build process:

- NATIVE: If you can't compile a native binary for your platform then add
  `NATIVE=false` as argument to `make`. This will produce a single native
  executable with OCaml runtime and Unison bytecode embedded.
- CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS, LDLIBS control the build process as usual.
  OCaml compiler will pass these arguments on to the C compiler and linker.
- To produce a statically linked executable, add arguments suitable for your
  platform and toolchain in your LDFLAGS. Static linking mostly makes no
  difference because some widely-used C libraries, like glibc, do not allow
  static linking, GTK does not allow static linking and there is nothing to
  link statically for the textual user interface in Windows and Cygwin.
  Examples of LDFLAGS values to enable static linking:
    `-static` or `-Wl,-static` for gcc (should also work for clang);
    `-link -static` for gcc in Windows (MinGW, Cygwin, MSYS2) ("-link" is
    required due to flexlink being used in the toolchain).
