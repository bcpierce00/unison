(** {1 Binary encoding/decoding of integers} *)

(** The functions in this section binary encode and decode integers to
    and from byte sequences.
    All following functions raise [Invalid_argument] if the space
    needed at index [i] to decode or encode the integer is not
    available.
    Little-endian (resp. big-endian) encoding means that least
    (resp. most) significant bytes are stored first.  Big-endian is
    also known as network byte order.  Native-endian encoding is
    either little-endian or big-endian depending on {!Sys.big_endian}.
    32-bit and 64-bit integers are represented by the [int32] and
    [int64] types, which can be interpreted either as signed or
    unsigned numbers.
    8-bit and 16-bit integers are represented by the [int] type,
    which has more bits than the binary encoding.  These extra bits
    are handled as follows: {ul
    {- Functions that decode signed (resp. unsigned) 8-bit or 16-bit
    integers represented by [int] values sign-extend
    (resp. zero-extend) their result.}
    {- Functions that encode 8-bit or 16-bit integers represented by
    [int] values truncate their input to their least significant
    bytes.}}
