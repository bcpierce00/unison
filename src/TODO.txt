Here we list planned and imagined improvements to Unison.  Ones that we
regard as most important are marked with more *s.  (Note that, since Unison
is no longer under active development [though it is still heavily used by
its original developers], the presence of a suggestion in this file is not
promise that anybody is going to implement it!)

###########################################################################

* CURRENT
* =======

* Make some preferences per-host
     - file-system type
     - canonical name of the host
     - fastcheck
     - backup
     - fs watcher command

* Work on the Unison side
     - create temp file
     - start watcher based on watcherosx switch, passing all paths as args
     - on each loop
         - parse results into shallow and deep ones
         - combine the two lists (marking which is which)
         - sort the list
         - if there are any adjacent pairs where the first is a prefix of the
           second, drop the second and mark the first as deep
         - go through the list and drop any item for which any PREFIX of
           its path matches 'ignore' and doesn't match 'ignorenot'
     - bulletproof, handling fatal errors and restarting completely from
       scratch if necessary

* The directory scanning optimization is currently disabled under Windows,
  as FAT partitions do not have directory modification times.
  we could check whether we are on an NTFS partition by calling
  GetVolumeInformation to get the filesystem name.

* We could defer most fingerprint computations to the propagation phase;
  this would improve the user experience and save some fingerprints:
  - do not compute fingerprint of new files during update detection
  - during reconciliation, try to decide what to do based on what is
    known so far
  - for undecided paths (two files), request checksums (in batch)
  - hashes are finally computed during propagation

* SOON
* ====

**** Document: root, fspath, path (local/not)

**** Nice code cleanup trick: Add a phantom type param to Pref (and Pred?)
     that prevents mutation from outside the module where the preference is
     defined (by exposing it with a weak type).

*** Un-writeable directories can't be copied.
    The 'rename' operation at the end of Files.copy will fail (at least on
    OSX) if the path being renamed points to a directory and that directory
    (not the one containing it!) is not writeable by the user.  To fix this,
    we'd need to notice when we are renaming a directory and temporarily
    make it writeable just before the rename and then make it what it should
    be just after.  But I don't feel like writing this bit of code right
    now, to handle such a corner case.  [BCP, November 2008]

*** [Marcus Sundman, 2008] Unison can't propagate changes in read-only
    folders. The correct way to do it is to temporarily add write
    permissions for the user to the folder, then do the changes and then
    reset the permissions. Now unison tries to just do the changes, which
    fails with a "permission denied" error.

It would be nice if Unison could have the "power" to copy write-protected
   files, maybe as an option.

*** Fix the pred module to understand negation and delete XXXnot predicates

*** Web
    - Add a "supported platforms" page mentioning system-specific stuff
    - Add an installation instructions page, removing it from the manual

** add '<meta http-equiv="expires" content="0">'
   to the head section of all the unison web pages.

*** See if we can get rid of some Osx.XXX stuff (e.g. ressLength!?)

* There is no way of selecting files with wildchar. I had to use
     ignorenot = Name opt/root/.unison/*.prf
     ignore = Name opt/root/.unison/*
  But this is inconvenient, but the worse is that it gets complicated very
  fast and I cannot make it for more complicated scenarios. I would expect
  something like (suggestion):
     Files = opt/root/.unison/*.prf

* When synchronizing FAT32, there could be an explicit command for
  ignoring attributes. The problem happens when one side is FAT32 but the
  other is not, or when mounting parameters are different.


* MERGE FUNCTIONALITY
* ===================

* Merge issues:
     - It would be better to ignore the exit status of the external merge
       tool and just look at what files it produced to decide what happened
     - The function that runs the external program should not grab stdin /
       stdout / stderr if Unison is running with the text UI.
     - The confirmation step should offer to display the new merged file.
     - (There are some older merge issues documented below)

**** Remaining problem with merging code:
       - create two directories, each containing a .txt file
       - sync so they are equal
       - change the file so that one region is in conflict and another
         region has changes that can be propagated correctly
       - sync
       - now we should be able to change the second region in just one file,
         sync again, and see the change propagate; instead, it conflicts
       - diagnosis: the merge stuff is not correctly updating the archive in
         the event of a partial reconciliation

** An idea for the interface to the external merge functionality:
  created a general mechanism for invoking external functionality...
    - in profile, declare a command of the form
           key M = external "merge ##1 ##2 ###" --> overwriting originals
      (concrete syntax open to discussion!).  Main parts are
         - what key to bind it to in the UI(s)
         - the command line to start up
         - variables (##1 and ##2) for the local and remote files
           (the remote file will automatically be copied to a local temp
           file, if this variable is used)
         - a variable (###) for a temporary output file
         - an indication of what to do with this output file
           (or maybe this could be automatic)
         - (should also indicate which machine(s) to run the command on?)

** small additions to merge functionality:
  - if the external merge program *deletes* one of the files it is given,
    Unison should interpret this as "Copy the other file onto this location
    (instead of merging)".  This will allow some other interesting
    functionality, e.g. external programs that may decide to keep both
    versions by moving one of them out of the way (mh-rename).
  - the invocation of the external 'diff' program should be selectable
    using the same conventions as the 'merge' program
  - would be nice to be able to invoke DIFFERENT merge programs
    depending on paths

** We should document other available merge tools, e.g.,
   idiff [BCP has a copy of the code for idiff that Norman sent.]

** Suggestion for extending merge functionality
     - add a new kind of preference -- a conditional stringlist preference
     - in the preference file, each value looks like either
            prefname = string
       or
            prefname = string WHEN Path PPPPP
            prefname = string WHEN Name XXXXX
            prefname = string WHEN Regex XXXXX
     - when we look up such a preference, we provide a current path, and it
       returns the one that matches the current path, if any


* BUILDING AND INSTALLING
* =======================



* DOCUMENTATION
* =============

** Add something to docs about how to use 'rootalias'.  Include an
   explanation of the semantics, a couple of examples, and a suggestion
   for how to debug what it's doing by turning on appropriate debugging
   flags.  (And maybe we should actually make the debug output there a
   bit more verbose?)

** Misc:
  - document good trick: use -1 switch to ssh if the paths are set up wrong
    on the remote host
  - should say whether trailing slashes are ok for paths; should say
    that leading slashes are illegal.
    ===> check
  - not so clear what you have to do with a Regex to match a directory
    and all its subfiles: foo or foo/ or foo/.* ?
    ===> the first. document it.  (Does foo/ match foo?  I don't think so.
         Document, one way or the other.)
  - what happens when files are included whose parent dirs are
    excluded? (With Regex?  With multiple Path and Name?)
    ===> document
  - the documentation is very good, but i couldn't find a description of how
    to respond to the prompts in the textual ui. is that explained
    somewhere?


* SMALL FUNCTIONALITY IMPROVEMENTS
* ================================

**** Please let me say
       root = ~/bla
     instead of requiring me to give an absolute path to my home dir.

** ~/foo seems to work on the command line but not in root = ~/foo in the
   config file.
   --
   Similarly: It seems that when one specifies logfile = foobar
   in the preferences file, then unison assumes that it is relative to the
   current directory. Since neither ~ nor $HOME are understood in the
   preference file, this is an inconvenience, because it forces the user to
   remember to run unison from the root directory.
   ===> Would be nice to support ~ internally

*** [Adrian Stephens, 2007] I would like the scope of rootalias to be
    expanded so that any command that expects a root will perform aliasing
    on the command.  In my application, I need to change the root statement
    as I move my machine from desk to the road.  I also have a "force"
    statement, and I also have to remember to edit this to match.  It would
    be more convenient to have to edit in a single place and, more
    importantly, avoids introducing any inconsistency.
    --- [BCP:] I like this idea.  However, since I'm struggling at the
    moment to find time to finish polishing 2.27 to become the new stable
    release, I am not going to undertake to implement it.  If you (or
    someone else) would like to give it a shot, here is what I think needs
    to happen:
      - Move the rootalias preference and the rootalias-expanding code from
        Update.root2stringOrAlias into the Common module (creating a new
        function there for rootalias expansion).
      - Find places like Recon.lookupPreferredRoot that deal with names of
        roots and add a call to the rootalias-expanding function.

*** Delete old backups mechanism and, instead, extend new one to cover its
    functionality
       - put backups in same dir as files by default
       - otherwise, put them in a central place if one is given
       - Update.incrVersionsOfBackups should not be externally visible

*** unison -help doesn't go to stdout so it's hard to pipe it into less
    ===> Probably *all* output should go to stdout, not stderr (but maybe
         we need a switch to recover the current behavior)

* Maybe we should write debugging and tracing information to stdout
  instead of stderr?

*** If a root resides on a `host' with an ever and unpredictably changing
    host name (like a public login cluster with dozens of machines and a
    shared file system), listing each possible host name for this root is
    not feasible.  The ability of specifying patterns in rootaliases would
    help a lot in this case.  I'm thinking of something like this:
    rootalias = //.*//afs/cern.ch/user/n/nagya ->
    //cern.ch//afs/cern.ch/user/n/nagya [NAGY Andras <nagya@inf.elte.hu>,
    March 12]
    ===> We definitely ought to do something about this problem -- it's
         increasingly common.  Not sure if this is the right proposal, but
         something.

*** Currently, if a file changes on either side between the initial update
    detection and the time when the transport module tries to propagate
    changes, the transport is aborted.  But if the change occurred on the
    replica that is being used as the source for the transfer (which will
    be the common case!), then there is no reason to abort -- we should
    just propagate the newest version.

*** When unison notices lock files in the archive directory, it should
    offer to delete them *for* the user, rather than forcing the user to
    delete them manually.

*** There is no command-line argument to tell Unison where the .unison
    directory is; Unison finds it in the environment or not at all.  I was
    able to workaround this with a symbolic link to put .unison where it was
    expected, but it seems like an easy option to add.

*** The other is possibly a bit more difficult, but more useful as well.  There
    is a brief window of vulnerability between when the local server is started
    and when the remote client connects to it.  (It's no longer than that
    because Unison won't take more than one connection at a time.)  I can
    tolerate it, but the window could be eliminated entirely by allowing socket
    connections to require a nonce.

** Allow 'default.prf' in place of 'default' for profile names

** [dlux@dlux.hu, Feb 2002] For some apps (e.g., some mail readers?),
  putting temp files in the same directory as the file we're about to
  overwrite is bad/dangerous. Some alternatives that we could
  consider...
    -  Add a configuration option for temporary directory and notice the
       user about the volume restrictions in the docs and then if the user
       does not consider it, then we use a non-atomic (copy + unlink)
       rename. In an ideal environment (where the user consider this
       restriction), it makes possible to sync a maildir folder while it is
       online!
    -  An even better solution: One more temporary file step. If the user
       sets the temporary directory, then we synchronize the files to that
       directory, and if the file is downloaded/uploaded fully, then we move
       it to a tempfile into the target directory (with .unison.tmp
       extension) and then rename it into the final name.

** Would be good to (optionally) change the semantics of the "backup"
   functionality, so that Unison would not insist on making a *full*
   backup of the whole replica, but just do so lazily.  (I.e., it would
   not make backups when files get put into the archive, but only when
   they actually get changed.)

** Would also be nice to allow the backup preference to be set
   differently on different hosts -- so that all the backups could be
   kept on one side (if there is no space on the other side, e.g.).  The
   obvious way to do this is to add a switch like '-suppressbackupsonroot
   BLAH' but this feels a bit ad hoc.  It would be nicer to decide, in
   general, which preferences can sensibly have different settings on
   different roots (e.g., the location of the archive dir, ...) and
   provide a general mechanism for setting them per-host.

** no spec for escaping regexp chars; spaces? newlines? tabs? others?
   mechanism for getting the list of files from another program (plugin)?
   ===> needs to be documented (look at rx.ml)

* [July 2002, S. Garfinkel] Maybe we should turn the 'time' option on by
  default.  We might need to help people a little on the upgrading,
  though.  When you did a sync with time=false, then a sync with
  time=true, you get a zillion conflicts...
     ==> This is probably a good idea, but I'm a little scared of all the
         messages we'd get from upgrading users
     ==> Also, "make" can get confused when the 'time' option is set

* URI pathname syntax
  Why is the following command wrong?
     unison -servercmd `which unison` /usr/local ssh://labrador/usr/local
  It took me three tries and careful reading of the documentation to
  figure it out.  I don't have any good suggestions here, other than
  that I think the whole issue of relative vs absolute pathnames needs
  serious thought.  I think the current interfaces do not work very
  well.  One possibility that I will float is that you invent a special
  character string to refer to the root of synchronization.
  E.g., interpret ~ as $HOME in roots.
  --
  Also: we should add the file:// syntax to URIs...
    file://C:/Necula    (C:/Necula on the local file system)
    file:////share/subdir  (//share/subdir as from the point of view of
                          the local file system)
    unison://host///share/subdir
  --
  Should local roots in a profile be canonized?
    Right now, we can have a relative root in the profile.  This
    is going to be a problem if unison is started in a different
    directory.

* At the moment, if Unison is interrupted during a non-atomic operation
  on the file system, the user has to clean things up manually, following
  the instructions in the the recovery log.  We should do that for them.
  (This is actually a bit tricky, since we need to be careful about what
  might happen if unison crashes during recovery, etc.  The best way to
  accomplish this would be to write a general logging/recovery facility
  in OCaml.)

* Dealing with ACLs: Maybe this is what we should do actually.  We could
  specify a user (and similarly a group) to unison.  It would be
  interpreted in a special way: if a file is owned by this user, unison
  will rather consider that the owner of the file is undefined.  So, when
  a file owned by an unknown user is synchronized, the file owner is set
  to the default user.  Then, on the next synchronizations, unison will
  consider that the owner has not been propagated and try again.  [Should
  be easy once the reconciler is made more modular]

* The -terse preference should suppress more (in fact, almost all)
  messages in the text ui.  See Dale Worley's message for a detailed
  proposal.

* [Joerg von den Hoff, 2009] I use unison (up to now) only from the command
  line and it's used from within scripts or Makefiles. it is therefore
  unfortunate that by default the GUI pops up and one has to use `unison -ui
  text' to avoid this. it would seem better to have it the other way round,
  i.e., to make the CLI the default and to require `unison -ui graphic' to
  start up the GUI from the command line (I would argue that people using the
  GUI regularly will start it anyway by double clicking the app)

add a switch '-logerrors' that makes unison log error messages to a
  separate file in addition to the standard logfile

Update checking over NFS might be *much* faster if we use only relative
  pathnames (absolute paths may require an RPC per level!?)

[Ben Wong, Aug 2002] Why not make unison fall back to addversionno if it
  would otherwise bomb out with an incorrect version number? That way I
  wouldn't have to educate people on how to use Unison at my site; it'd
  "just work".

The -sortbysize is nice, but what I would really like is a -limitbysize.
  When I'm connected over a modem line, I would like not to transfer the
  larger files that need synchronization. That can wait until I am
  connected via a faster connection. What I presently do is allow unison
  to run in -sortbysize mode, and abort once I have all my little, more
  important files. -limitbysize should simply filter the list of transfer
  to only those that are below the threshold size. The syntax is
  obvious... It should be -limitbysize xxx, where xxx is the size
  (preferably in kb, but bytes will do as well).

[From Yan Seiner]
  Can unison modify the (*nix) environment to show the
  ip/name/some_other_id of the system making the connection?  This would
  help tremendously.
  For example, vtun does this:
  ---
  root      6319  0.0  0.6  1984  852 ?        S<   Aug27   0:37 vtund[s]:
  bgsludge tun tun10
  root      6324  0.0  0.6  1984  852 ?        S<   Aug27   2:00 vtund[s]:
  cardinal tun tun0
  root     17001  0.0  0.6  1984  848 ?        S<   Aug27   0:05 vtund[s]:
  wtseller tun tun11
  root     20100  0.0  0.6  1984  852 ?        S<   Aug28   0:02 vtund[s]:
  cardridg tun tun1
  ----
  So I know I have four sessions, to each named machine, and I know
  immediately who is connected and who is not.  If I have to kill a
  session, I don't kill the wrong one.

Dale Worley's suggestion for relocating archives:
  >   You're right: it's not all that tricky.  So would you be happy if you
  >   could run unison in a special mode like this
  >       unison -relocate //old-host1//path1 //old-host2//path2 \
  >                        //new-host1//path1 //new-host2//path2
  >   (where all the hosts and paths are normalized) and it would move the
  >   archives for you on both machines?
  Actually, I think that what you want is for the user to specify the
  old paths in *normalized* form and the new paths in *non-normalized*
  form.  That is, unison uses the old paths literally as provided by the
  user, but it applies the usual normalization algorithm to the new
  paths.
  This may sound strange, but I think that it's the Right Thing:
  - There is no guarantee that the normalization algorithm, applied to
    the old paths as the user used to specify them, normalizes to the
    the normalized paths that are recorded in the archive.  Indeed,
    there may no longer be *any* path which normalizes to the recorded
    paths.
  - The user can extract the normalized old paths from the second line
    of the archive files.  This is clumsy, but reliable.  And we don't
    intend the user to relocate an archive very often.
  - But for the new paths, you want to normalize what the user supplies,
    because he doesn't know in advance how Unison is going to normalize
    the new paths, and may well specify them incorrectly.  That would
    leave him with a relocated archive that he might not be able to use
    at all.
  You might want to put quotes around the pathnames in the second line
  of the archive, since MS-Windows directory names can contain spaces,
  etc.

Would be nice to be able to run unison in a special mode like this
    unison -relocate //old-host1//path1 //old-host2//path2 \
                     //new-host1//path1 //new-host2//path2
  (where all the hosts and paths are canonized) and have it move the
  archives for you on both machines?

For safety...
  - Add a preference 'maxdelete' taking an integer parameter, default 100
    (or perhaps even less -- keeping it fairly small will help naive users
    avoid shooting themselves in the foot).  A negative number means
    skip this check (i.e., infinity).
  - When the transport subsystem gets control (i.e., just after the user
    says 'go' to the user interface, when not running in batch mode)
    it first checks the number of files that are going to be deleted
    (including all the contents of any directories that are marked for
    deletion).  If it is more than maxdelete (and maxdelete is
    positive), then...
       - If we're in batch mode (batch=true), we halt without doing
         anything.
       - If we're not in batch mode, we display a warning message and
         make the user confirm.  (If they do *not* confirm, it would be
         nice to dump them back into the user interface again, but this
         would require a little rewriting of our control flow.)
  - Would also be nice to include a display in the UI someplace that says
    how many files are to be deleted/changed/created plus how many bytes
    to be transferred, and a warning signal (display in red or something)
    if these exceed the current setting of maxdelete.

It would be nice if unison had a tool by which it could regenerate all
  the MD5 sums and compare them to what it has stored, then produce a list
  of files that are different.  I obviously cannot count on file size and
  date in  this case; those may not have changed but the contents may be
  corrupt.

If the connection to the server goes away and then comes back up, it
  would be nice if Unison would transparently re-establish it (at least,
  when this makes sense!)

Better documentation of the -backups flag, and a way to expire old backups

Add a preference that makes the reconciler ignore prefs-only differences
  between files (not updating the archive, though -- just suppressing
  the difference -- will this slow things down too much??  Maybe it needs
  to happen in the update detector, before things are transmitted across
  the network.)

Perhaps we should interpret both / and the local separator as path
  separators, i.e., under Windows / and \, under Mac / and :, and under
  Unix just /.  For Windows this will be fine, since / is not allowed in
  filenames.

Maybe we should never emit a conflict for modtimes; instead, we just
  propagate the largest one.

[Ivo Welch] I would do a quick test of case sensitivity in the program
itself at the time you do a first prf sync, so that the user does not have
to bother with it.  Just write two files on each end which differ in case,
and see if there is overwriting.  Then do the smart thing.  The long-named
file in the .unison directory should keep this information thereafter.
(BCP: Implementing this is more difficult than it might seem.  E.g.,
whenever a symlink is followed we might need to go through the same
exercise.  And then we'd need to be able to deal with replicas that are not
all one way or the other...)

[Ivo Welch] I would give some examples in the man page of what an xxx
specification is.

[Ivo Welch] I would allow '--' switches, in addition to the '-' switch spec.

[Ivo Welch] On OSX, create a link from ~/Library/Application Support/Unison
to .unison, just for ease of finding it. It took me a long time to find my
.prf files.

[Ivo Welch] the OSX GUI front end should be clear which side (left or right)
the local host and which side the remote host is.

* USER INTERFACE
* ==============

** in gtk ui, display green checkmark next to finished items even if their
   direction indicates a conflict; do not list such items as "skipped" at
   the end

** In both UIs, show how many bytes/files were successfully transferred
   at the end

** Should support auto-termination of the graphical UI (switch-controlled)
    * Unison starts in the usual way and checks for changes
    * If there are no conflicts, it proceeds without waiting for confirmation
    * If there *are* conflicts, it waits for instructions, just like now
    * In either case, when it's finished transferring the changes, it quits

* [Matthew Swift] in the GTK gui at least,
  display the total MB or #files or whatever it is that the ticking
  %-meter is referring to when it goes from 0 to 100.  it is useful to
  know how big the xfer is going to be before starting it (might induce me
  to choose "sort by size", or abandon and choose a smaller subset, etc.).
  Also, esp. since the gui is single-threaded and unresponsive, i would
  like to know what size of a synch that I am for example 50% or 22%
  through.  I know that an ETA and other things we're used to from many
  downloading apps would require quite a bit of code, but it would help a
  lot just to display whatever constant is represented by 100%.


* [BCP] Error reporting for per-file problems during updating leaves
  something to be desired.  In particular, there's no indication even of
  which host the problem occurred on.  (I added something that includes
  "root 1" or "root 2", but I'm not sure that's better than nothing.)  If
  there are errors on both hosts, only one will be reported.  If there
  are lots of errors in a subdir, only the first will be reported.
  Recon.propagateUpdates would be a starting point for changes.

* [Jamey Leifer]
  [graphic ui, wishlist] The documentation topics aren't searchable.  As
  a result "unison -doc running | less" is still indispensable if one
  wants to find anything.  I suggest adding a box

     "search in this topic: ---"

  which is always available in the doc viewer.  It would be nice to
  support keyboard shortcuts in the "less" style, namely "/", "n", and
  "N" (i.e. search, next, previous) to avoid too much clicking.

  [graphic ui, wishlist] Ditto as far as searchability for diff reports.

* Would be nice to have a keystroke in the UI that means 'add the current
  directory to the set of ignore patterns.'

* In the text UI, during the transport phase, print each file being
  transferred on *one* line, with an arrow to indicate which way (and
  dropping the explicit indication of which host from and to).  The
  logfile should be more explicit.

* The unison gui currently displays a percentage completion in the lower right
  corner.  I would find it comforting if it would also display an effective
  bandwidth there, i.e., how many bits per second are flowing through the
  transport layer?  I make this request because owing to a hardware
  catastrophe, I have just started using Unison through the phone lines, and
  it seems to do nothing for a long period of time.  I don't know whether
  to blame the cheap modem, the cheap ISP, or whether Unison simply isn't
  telling me that bits are flowing through the wire.  (netstat -tn
  suggests not much is happening, but I don't know if the results can
  be trusted.)

* Would it be hard to add "tool tips" to the buttons in the UI?
  ==> Look for "tooltip" in examples/testgtk.ml.
      The easiest way is with a toolbar, but you can also add tooltips to any
      widget (cf lines 867 and after).

* > On a line, I would like to have a description of the action to be taken in
  > clear words: (e.g. will erase file on local or will copy from local to

  This might be a good use for "tool tips," if I knew how to make them work
  using lablGTK.

* The menu help for left/right arrow both said `transfer local to local'.
  Not helpful.  The items in question are pathnames, which you might not
  have to abbreviate.  To save space one might consider replacing any
  common prefix, and also short prefixes that look like they might be
  automounter goo, with an ellipsis.  Then show, e.g., 20 chars.  I'd
  also be willing to name paths in my profile, e.g., replica flatcoat =
  /home/cellar/nr replica cellar = /m/cellar60/nr This would be
  especially attractive if my short names were meaningful on the command
  line.

* In the GTK user interface, it would be nice to be able to put up a window
  displaying the contents of the log file (and add log messages to it
  dynamically as we're working).  Be careful, though: the log could get
  large and we don't want this to be too slow.

* Could there be an option between -ui text and -ui graphic that when combine
  with -batch and -auto would start in text mode, but pop up an interactive
  graphic window when real conflicts happens.

* [Jamey Leifer] I think "unison -doc" should be mapped to "unison
  -doc topics" and the error message for the former eliminated.

Unison's gui offers an `Actions' menu with a variety of features
  regarding preferences.  I would love to see an action with the following
  semantics: if the two files differ only in their modification time,
  prefer the older modification time.
  ===> This would be easy to add, but I am beginning to worry that we are
       getting too many funny little switches like this.  We should think
       about them all together and make sure they make sense.

I'm watching it sync a very large file that I don't want anyway, and I'm in
  a hurry. I'd like a way to say "forget that file, I don't care about it, go
  on to the next one you have to sync". Doesn't sound hard...?
  [Perdita Stevens, Perdita.Stevens@dcs.ed.ac.uk, Mar 14 2002]
  ===> It's not trivial (involves some subtle stuff about our RPC
       implementation and the single-thread nature of the GUI), but might
       not be impossible either.

"Quit" during synchronization should abort all current operations (so
  that temporary files are deleted) before exiting.
  ===> Again, requires some careful thinking about how this would work
       with the RPC layer.

It would be nice to have a command in the GUI that would allow a single
  path within the replica to be selected from a file dialog and
  synchronized.

[From Manuel Serrano] Would be nice to put the arrows in different
  directions in different colors, so that, e.g., you could quickly scan the
  list of changes and make sure that they are all in the same direction
  ===> We tried this, but we couldn't find color combinations that did not
  seem confusing.  (Two different shades of green?  Three? ...)  If we
  really want this, probably the best is to put in some preferences for the
  user to control the colors of all the arrows individually.

Text mode user interface should be brought up to date with graphical
  interface (it should prompt for profile creation, root
  entry, etc.; command characters should be the same; ...)

Since the manual is pretty big, it would be nice if the on-line version
  were accessible through cascading menus, allowing direct access to
  individual subsections.  It would also be nice if it were formatted a
  bit more attractively, using proportional-width fonts, etc.  (Does GTK
  have something like an RTF widget?)

If I have a change I look at the detail window. It would be nice to be
  able to click on one of the lines there instead of pressing one of <-
  or ->. For one thing in the detail window the relative position of the
  two files is up and down and translating that to <- or -> is somewhat
  unintuitive.

Also, it would be nice to highlight in the detailed window the
   elements that have changed.

The UI window should display the current roots somewhere.

There should be a -geometry command-line interface, following the usual X
  conventions.

put in a command-line option that makes fatal errors exit right away
  without displaying anything in the graphical UI (for debugging)

Use the CTree widget to display the list of files
  Add the ability to close and open directories in the UI.

it would be nice to give a visual indication of which files are
  particularly big, so that the user can tell where the transfer
  operations may get slowed down.  Maybe a "size bar" showing the log
  of the size (perhaps also color coded).
  ===> less urgent now because we can re-sort the update items by size

Would it be hard to allow long-running transfers to be aborted?
  For instance, the key "/" aborts the transmission of the selected file
  OR:
  Allow the user to terminate individual operations by clicking a
  "cancel" button.  (This is not completely straightforward because
  the whole program is single-threaded.  But it should be possible for
  the low-level transport code in remote.ml to realize that the
  operation has been aborted, clean up, and raise an exception.)

It would be nice if the initial 'usage' message were not so long.  Maybe
  we could split options into 'novice' and 'expert' ones, and only print
  the novice ones (with an indication how to obtain the full expert
  printout).

The UI for the diff functionality needs some polishing.  (Also, it should
be merged with the new "merge" functionality.)

would be nice to be able to "Proceed" just the selected line

might be nice if the GUI would beep when finished syncing (needs to be
  switch-selectable and off by default, naturally).  Is this easy with
  LablGTK?


* TIDYING
* =======

* Go through the sources and make all fatal and transient error messages
  as informative as possible

More documentation (especially in the interface files) is always nice.
  In particular, there isn't enough documentation of the big picture.
  It isn't clear how to fit together archives, servers, paths, roots,
  update detection, reconciliation, conflict resolution, or the user
  interface...

Ocamlexc v1.0, the uncaught exceptions analyzer for Objective Caml is now
  available from Pessaux's home page.  It would be fun to run it over the
  Unison sources and see if it reveals any problems.


* LARGER EXTENSIONS
* =================

Fast update checking would be cool... Some resources:
   FAM (used in Enlightenment)
   dnotify (linux 2.4)
   BSD kqueue
   the "VFS stacking layer" implemented by a guy at Columbia

[From JMS]
  Some update detection speed improvement suggestions:
  - Read the FFS (Fast Filesystem) paper for hints
  - change the working directory instead of using absolute paths; this
    avoids calls to the evil iname(?) facility in the kernel
  - work breadth-first instead of depth first, to keep things in the
    kernel cache

Rewrite recon.ml in a more modular way.  Probably, have for each property
  a function taking the previous file state and the state on each
  replicas, and returning in what the synchronization operation should be
  (nothing, left, right, conflict); a combinator then merge the results.

How about a facility so that you can specify more than one pair of
  file systems for a single invocation of Unison? This would be like
  calling Unison multiple times, except that it would ask all the
  questions at once.  Better yet, we could actually deal with the
  multi-replica case.  (The latter is pretty hard.)

What about invoking some user-specified operation on each file as it
  is transferred?  Or in each directory where things have changed?
  (This will require some careful design work.)

Consider using other authentication services (e.g. Kerberos) instead
  of / in addition to ssh.

What happens when we synchronize, then decide to ignore some existing file
  What happens to the entry in the archive?  If mirroring, it may be
  large, we probably want to delete it from the archive.

File level synchronization (bookmarks, mailboxes)

It might be nice to implement an (optional) safety check that detects
  aliasing within a replica due to followed links (or hard links) and
  complains if it finds any.  This should not be *too* expensive, since
  we already know all the inode numbers.  (Even if it *is* expensive, it
  might be useful to allow users to do this occasionally, if they are
  paranoid.)
