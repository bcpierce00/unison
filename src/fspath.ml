(* CAREFUL!
   Windows porting issue:
     Unix.LargeFile.stat "c:\\windows\\" will fail, you must use
     Unix.LargeFile.stat "c:\\windows" instead.
     The standard file selection dialog, however, will return a directory
     with a trailing backslash.
     Therefore, be careful to remove a trailing slash or backslash before
     calling this in Windows.
     BUT Windows shares are weird!
       //raptor/trevor and //raptor/trevor/mirror are directories
       and //raptor/trevor/.bashrc is a file.  We observe the following:
       Unix.LargeFile.stat "//raptor" will fail.
       Unix.LargeFile.stat "//raptor/" will fail.
       Unix.LargeFile.stat "//raptor/trevor" will fail.
       Unix.LargeFile.stat "//raptor/trevor/" will succeed.
       Unix.LargeFile.stat "//raptor/trevor/mirror" will succeed.
       Unix.LargeFile.stat "//raptor/trevor/mirror/" will fail.
       Unix.LargeFile.stat "//raptor/trevor/.bashrc/" will fail.
       Unix.LargeFile.stat "//raptor/trevor/.bashrc" will succeed.
       Not sure what happens for, e.g.,
         Unix.LargeFile.stat "//raptor/FOO"
       where //raptor/FOO is a file.
       I guess the best we can do is:
         To stat //host/xxx, assume xxx is a directory, and use
         Unix.LargeFile.stat "//host/xxx/". If xxx is not a directory,
         who knows.
         To stat //host/path where path has length >1, don't use
         a trailing slash.
       The way I did this was to assume //host/xxx/ is a root directory.
         Then by the invariants of fspath it should always end in /.

     Unix.LargeFile.stat "c:" will fail.
     Unix.LargeFile.stat "c:/" will succeed.
     Unix.LargeFile.stat "c://" will fail.
   (The Unix version of ocaml handles either a trailing slash or no
   trailing slash.)

Invariant on fspath will guarantee that argument is OK for stat
*)

(* HACK:
   Under Windows 98,
     Unix.opendir "c:/" fails
     Unix.opendir "c:/*" works
     Unix.opendir "/" fails
   Under Windows 2000,
     Unix.opendir "c:/" works
     Unix.opendir "c:/*" fails
     Unix.opendir "/" fails

   Unix.opendir "c:" works as well, but, this refers to the current
