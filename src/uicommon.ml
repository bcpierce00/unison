   These are not OS threads or parallel running domains. There is no
   preemption and only a single thread is executing at any time.)

   Many (thousands) transport threads can run concurrently and
   independently of each other. All threads run to completion as long as
   there are no errors or only [Util.Transient] exceptions are raised.

   The threads are _not_ guaranteed to run to completion when an exception
   other than [Util.Transient] is raised in any of the threads. This means
   that the threads may not even be able to complete their own cleanup
   code and may leak resources. There must be separate resource cleanup code
   that can be run after the threads have been stopped either forcefully or
   by running to completion.

   When an uncaught exception other than [Util.Transient] is raised in any
   of the threads, the following happens:

     - the thread raising the exception is aborted (all exception handlers
       are run normally, so this thread is expected to run all its cleanup
       code);

     - any threads still waiting to be started are immediately cancelled
       (they will not have run any meaningful code and don't require any
       cleanup);

     - any threads that have already run to completion are not impacted
       in any way;

     - any (sleeping) threads running concurrently with the raising thread
       are stopped, which may have a different meaning depending on where
       in the execution each thread was when it was stopped:

         - some threads will not be able to continue at all (they are
           never woken up);
         - some threads may be woken up and may be able to continue
           running for a short while but may get an error the next time
           when accessing some resource (and may be able to run the error
           handler);
         - some threads may receive an exception and be able to continue
           running for a short while.

     - any exceptions raised in/by threads that are stopped, are ignored;

     - the original exception from the first raising thread is reraised.

   The code run in these thread must _not_ assume that:
     - it will be run to completion;
     - it can run some or all of its cleanup handlers;
     - it will have had a chance to run a certain amount of its code;
     - it will even know that it was stopped.
   Depending on where and how a thread was stopped, it may be collected by
   GC without any additional code ever being run in that thread.


   There is a limit regulating how many threads can be run concurrently in
   the [Transport] module. An attempt is made to not start threads that will
   not be able to run due to this limit. This delayed starting is done for
   two reasons. First, to make the cleanup in case of an uncaught exception
   easier: if the thread was never run then there is nothing to clean up.
   Second, even though the threads themselves are extremely lightweight,
   they still consume some resources and this will add up when the number
   of threads grows to hundreds of thousands and millions.

   Not starting up all threads at once and allowing finished threads to
   be collected by GC as soon as possible can potentially reduce the memory
   requirement by gigabytes. (This is a reference to the old implementation
   that started all threads in one go and kept them all around until all
   were completed. This approach could result in running out of memory when
   syncing large number of updates.) *)
