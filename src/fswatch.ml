Protocol description
====================

  The file monitoring process receives commands from stdin and
  responds to stdout. Commands and responds are single lines composed
  of an identifier followed by a single space and a space separated
  list of arguments. Arguments are percent-encoded. At the minimum,
  spaces and newlines must be escaped. The two processes should accept
  any other escaped character.

  Unison and the child process starts by indicating the protocol
  version they support.  At the moment, they should just output the
  line 'VERSION 1'.

  Debugging is enabled by the 'DEBUG' command.

  At any time, the child process can signal an error by sending an
  "ERROR msg" message.

  When Unison start scanning a part of the replica, it emits command:
  'START hash fspath path', thus indicating the archive hash (that
  uniquely determines the replica) the replica's fspath and the path
  where the scanning process starts. The child process should start
  monitoring this location, then acknowledge the command by sending an
  'OK' response.
  When Unison starts scanning a directory, it emits the command
  'DIR path1', where 'path1' is relative to the path given by the
  START command (the location of the directory can be obtained by
  concatenation of 'fspath', 'path', and 'path1'). The child process
  should then start monitoring the directory, before sending an 'OK'
  response.
  When Unison encounters a followed link, it emits the command
  'LINK path1'. The child process is expected to start monitoring
  the link target before replying by 'OK'.
  Unison signals that it is done scanning the part of the replica
  described by the START process by emitting the 'DONE' command. The
  child process should not respond to this command.

  Unison can ask for a list of paths containing changes in a given
  replica by sending the 'CHANGES hash' command. The child process
  responds by a sequence of 'RECURSIVE path' responses, followed by a
  'DONE' response. These paths should be relative to the replica
  'fspath'. The child process will not have to report this changes any
  more: it can consider that Unison has taken this information into
  account once and for all. Thus, it is expected to thereafter report
  only further changes.

  Unison can wait for changes in a replica by emitting a 'WAIT hash'
  command. It can watch several replicas by sending a serie of these
  commands. The child process is expected to respond once, by a
  'CHANGE hash1 ... hash2' response that lists the changed replicas
  among those included in a 'WAIT' command, when changes are
  available. It should cancel pending waits when any other command is
  received.

  Finally, the command 'RESET hash' tells the child process to stop
  watching the given replica. In particular, it can discard any
  pending change information for this replica.
